[[Boost]]
== Boost

If you don't know what does `boost` means in Elasticsearch. I would suggest to give a quick read at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_boosting_query_clauses.html[Elasticsearch documentation] on `boost`

In Grails Elasticsearch plugin, `boost` is possible in two ways:

* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-index-boost.html[Index time boost] or Static boosting
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.4/mapping-boost.html[Query time boost]
